## Recursion

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (`foundation/28-recursion`). 
Edit the `RecursionUtils.java` file and implement the recursive methods found within.

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/recursion/*.java
```

After it compiles successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

```bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ java com.bloc.recursion.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, your recursion methods worked!
