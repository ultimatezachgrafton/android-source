## Logic

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (`foundation/16-logic`). 
In the src path is a file named `Logic.java`. Open it and fill in the portions of the code 
where the comments have indicated to do so.

When you've completed your work, test your code by compiling it with the following command:

```bash
$ javac -d bin/ src/com/bloc/logic/Logic.java
```

Correct any and all errors that appear. If something goes wrong during compilation, it will 
be a result from the modifications you've made.

After it returns successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

```bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, run the following command:

```bash
$ java com.bloc.logic.Logic
```

If you see the _right_ message, you've rocked it!
