## Collections

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (`foundation/27-collections`). 
Edit `FavoritePastries.java` and implement the methods which have been indicated. After you've finished, 
compile your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/collections/*.java 
```

After it compiles successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

```bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

```bash
$ java -ea com.bloc.collections.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, you've successfully implemented your own version of List!
