## Best Practices

Open your command prompt and **CD** into this README's directory (`foundation/14-best-practices`). 
In the `src` path is a file named `WorstPractices.java`. Open it and correct all of the ugliness you find within.

## All Done?

Commit and push your work to GitHub:

```bash(/Users/your_user_name/where/you/keep/your/work/android-source)
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Checkpoint 14 completed"
$ git push
```
